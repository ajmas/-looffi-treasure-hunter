    <h1>Looffi Treasure Hunter</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        A scavenger hunt application that was quickly thrown together,
        for an event that was being organised. For now, it should be
        considered just enough effort to address the requirement.
      </p>
      <p>This 'app' makes use of local storage to save your state, and
        does not persist anything to the cloud. This is done both for
        simplicity, to reduce network dependency and because there really
        isn't any need for anything more.
      </p>
      <p>The project is open source, written using Quasar and Vue. The
      <a href="https://github.com/ajmas/looffi-treasure-hunter">Source code</a>
      is host on GitHub.</p>
      <p>Contributions welcome.</p>
